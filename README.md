# About Me
I have always loved working with data and information my whole life to make more informed decisions, and I want to be able to use this passion to help others make more informed decisions with more complicated problems. I also love working with other people and try to incorporate other ideas as much as possible. Data/input from other people also provides a lot when trying to solve a problem.
